              <p>Wooopit is an application that allows ordering food online. I was involved in its development from the very start and worked on it until my departure from Human Device. Wooopit iOS app was written fully in Swift, using popular frameworks, such as Alamofire and Realm. One of the biggest challenges during development was filling it with dynamic content that highly affected the look of most screens. The application went live in June 2017.</p>
